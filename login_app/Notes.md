# NOTES

#### Always while making a route in api, in every route should connect the DB, unlike backend
#### Always provide a string in the paassword while testing API in postman eg:
<p>123456❌<br/>"123456"✅</p>

#### In logout the token is not getting deleted at second request to the api route so need a better replacement
